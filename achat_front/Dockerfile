# #### Stage 1: Build the angular application
# FROM node:12 as build

# # Configure the main working directory inside the docker image. 
# # This is the base directory used in any further RUN, COPY, and ENTRYPOINT 
# # commands.
# WORKDIR /app

# # Copy the package.json as well as the package-lock.json and install 
# # the dependencies. This is a separate step so the dependencies 
# # will be cached unless changes to one of those two files 
# # are made.
# COPY package*.json ./
# RUN npm install

# # Copy the main application
# COPY . ./

# # Build the application
# RUN npm run build -- --outputPath=./dist/out 


#### Stage 2, use the compiled app, ready for production with Nginx
FROM nginx

# Copy the angular build from Stage 1
COPY /dist/crudtuto-Front/ /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy our custom nginx config
COPY /nginx-custom.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf


# Expose port 80 to the Docker host, so we can access it 
# from the outside.
EXPOSE 80

ENTRYPOINT ["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]
